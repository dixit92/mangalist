"""The volumes MVP's download records, qBittorrent connection and download settings (schema migration 5).

- Download records are rows of the ``ledger`` table (created in schema 1 for exactly this, unused until now):
  ``tool`` = ``'qbittorrent'``, ``external_ref`` = the torrent's info hash (lowercase hex), ``destination`` =
  the target folder (absolute: downloads run only in the Unraid container, which sees one path per folder),
  ``request`` = JSON (the wanted volumes and the release's title / urls / parsed volumes), ``status`` =
  :class:`~mangalist.downloads.contracts.DownloadStatus`. Schema 5 adds ``filed_files``, ``copied`` and
  ``plan_id`` (the journal plan that filed the release). Status changes are compare-and-set (``expect``), so
  two arrivals passes can never move one record twice.
- ``qbittorrent_connection`` (id = 1): URL, user name, password, TLS choice. The password is kept here and
  not in ``settings`` (``config.load()`` / ``config.save()`` copy every settings key around), as
  ``mangapixer_connection.token`` is; it is never logged and never in a ``repr``
  (:class:`~mangalist.downloads.contracts.QbtConnection` hides it).
- Settings (plain ``settings`` keys): ``downloads.save_path`` (where qBittorrent saves the ``mangalist``
  category) and ``downloads.remove_completed`` (default on).
- **The download budget** (2026-10-09, no migration): a QUEUED record (the ledger's own schema-1 ``'queued'``) is a send
  waiting for room under the cap. Everything a later hand-over needs lives in its ``request`` JSON, written at queueing
  time: the release (title, ``.torrent`` URL, page, parsed volumes, size, ...), the wanted volumes, ``only_missing``
  (the partial-or-whole choice) and ``queue_order`` (the queue sorts by it, then by id: oldest first; "move to the
  front" gives a record an order below every other). The target folder is ``destination``, as for any record. Every
  record also carries what it counts against the cap: ``budget_bytes`` / ``budget_source`` (the release's size, the
  selected files' total of a partial send, then qBittorrent's own figure once it reports one) and, for a FAILED record,
  ``in_client`` (False once the torrent is seen gone from qBittorrent). Older records without these keys count their
  ``size_bytes`` (the release's size).
- **More than one tool** (the Suwayomi MVP, 2026-10-10; no migration): a ledger is bound to one ``tool`` -
  ``DownloadLedger(store)`` is qBittorrent's, exactly as before (every query filters on ``tool = 'qbittorrent'``);
  ``DownloadLedger(store, tool='suwayomi')`` holds the chapter downloads; ``DownloadLedger(store, tool=None)`` reads
  every tool's records (the GUI's In progress list) and refuses to create one. A chapter record is ONE chapter:
  ``external_ref`` = Suwayomi's chapter id, ``request`` = JSON (the chapter's number, name, scanlator, the source's
  id and name, the manga's id and title, the batch it was sent in), the same statuses (SENT = in Suwayomi's queue,
  DOWNLOADED = Suwayomi has the CBZ, FILED = in the library, REMOVED = Suwayomi's copy deleted). Chapter downloads
  are outside the download budget (:mod:`mangalist.downloads.budget`: torrents only).
- **Suwayomi's connection** (:class:`SuwayomiSettings`): address, optional basic-auth login and the folder MangaList
  reads Suwayomi's downloads from, in the ``meta`` table (key ``suwayomi.connection``) - not in ``settings``, which
  ``config.load()`` / ``config.save()`` copy around - and the per-series choices (the matched Suwayomi manga, the
  scanlation group; ``suwayomi.series.<id>``). The password is never logged and never in a ``repr``.

:class:`DownloadLedger` wraps a :class:`~mangalist.store.Store` (it uses ``store.connect()`` and the
settings), so the store class itself is unchanged. It implements
:class:`~mangalist.downloads.contracts.DownloadStore`. No Qt here.
