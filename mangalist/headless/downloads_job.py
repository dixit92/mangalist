"""The ``downloads`` job for the headless runner: one arrivals pass (file finished ``mangalist`` torrents into
their series folders, then "Remove Completed"; :mod:`mangalist.downloads.arrivals`), then one pass of the download
queue (:func:`mangalist.downloads.queueing.run_queue`: sizes from qBittorrent, then queued downloads handed over in
order while they fit under the download budget - the room Remove Completed just freed is used at once).

Registered by :func:`mangalist.headless.jobs.build_registry`, enabled only when downloads are on
(``MANGALIST_DOWNLOADS``), every ``MANGALIST_DOWNLOADS_SCHEDULE`` (default ``every 1h``). Skipped while no
qBittorrent connection is stored, or while no client is wired. The qBittorrent client comes from
:func:`mangalist.services.qbittorrent.client_from_connection` (the Sources lane; the integrator wires it), or
from *client_factory* (tests).

**Chapter downloads** (the Suwayomi MVP, 2026-10-10): when chapter records are in progress, the same job first runs one
chapter arrivals pass (:mod:`mangalist.downloads.chapter_arrivals`: chapters Suwayomi finished -> the series folder,
named by the scheme; Suwayomi then deletes its copy) with the client from
:func:`mangalist.services.suwayomi.client_from_connection` (or *chapter_client_factory*, tests) and the stored download
folder. The qBittorrent part then runs exactly as before; the after-filing step (rescan, MangaPixer scan) sees the
chapters filed too. Without chapter records nothing about the job changes.
