"""The download queue: sends that would take MangaList past its download budget wait here (QUEUED records) and are
handed to qBittorrent, in queue order, as room frees up. No Qt here.

Owner, 2026-10-09: "the rest of the items are queued if that cap is reached" (the budget itself: :mod:`.budget`).

- **Submitting** (:func:`submit`, the GUI's send): the pick is checked exactly as a send is (:func:`.service.check_pick`:
  target folder, wanted volumes, save path, not already queued or in qBittorrent). Then the budget decides: it fits ->
  sent now; it would go over the cap, or others are waiting in the queue (first come, first served) -> recorded as
  QUEUED, with everything a later send needs (the ledger's ``request`` JSON: the release, the wanted volumes, the
  partial-or-whole choice; the target folder) - unless the owner chose to send it now, past the cap. A release bigger
  than the cap on its own is never queued (it would never fit): it is refused unless the owner sends it past the cap.
- **Handing over** (:func:`run_queue`; the hourly ``downloads`` job and "Check downloads now", after the arrivals
  pass and Remove Completed): first every record's size is brought up to date from qBittorrent (its own figure for the
  files it downloads) and FAILED records whose torrent is gone stop counting; then the queue is walked in order. The
  first item that does not fit stops the walk - nothing behind it jumps ahead. An item bigger than the cap on its own
  (the owner lowered the cap after queueing it) is passed over with a note on the record ("send it now, past the cap,
  or remove it"), so it never blocks the others. An item is claimed (QUEUED -> SENT) before it is added, so two passes
  never send it twice; when qBittorrent cannot be reached it goes back to the queue, in its place, and the walk stops;
  when the send itself fails (the release is gone from nyaa, the target folder is gone, a partial pack cannot be set
  up) it becomes FAILED with the reason and the walk goes on.
- **The owner's overrides**: :func:`send_now` (a queued item, past the cap), ``ledger.move_to_front`` and
  ``ledger.cancel`` (remove it from the queue).

Every hand-over and every refusal is logged at INFO with the sizes in GB, the cap and the place in the queue.
